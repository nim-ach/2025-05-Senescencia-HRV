# Introduction

<!--- 
OPENING HOOK SUGGESTION: 
Start with 2-3 sentences that link a clinically relevant syndrome/condition to an unresolved mechanistic question.

- Highlight its epidemiological or public health burden. 
- Introduce the core system/mechanism under investigation as the study's focus.
--->
[opening paragraph here...]

<!--- 
## 1. **Mechanistic Context & Knowledge Gaps**

LAYER 1 SUGGESTION: 
Summarize established foundational knowledge about the system/mechanism. 
- Cite 2-3 key papers that define current consensus. 
- Mention widely used metrics/tools in the field (e.g., "[METRIC] measures [PHENOMENON]").
--->
[established knowledge summary...]

<!--- 
### 1.2. Emerging Contradictions & Unanswered Questions  

LAYER 2 SUGGESTION: 
Highlight emerging contradictions or unanswered questions. Use contrastive language:
- "While [X] is well-documented, [Y] remains controversial..."
- "Recent studies suggest [Z], but fail to address [GAP]..."
--->
[gap identification...]

<!--- 
### 1.3. Methodological Limitations  

LAYER 3 SUGGESTION: 
Critique methodological limitations of current approaches. 
- Explain why traditional tools/metrics are insufficient (e.g., "Static measures overlook [DYNAMIC PROCESS]"). 
- Introduce the need for innovative methods (e.g., "[NEW METHOD] better captures [COMPLEXITY]").
--->
[methodological critique...]

<!--- 
## 2. **Methodological Rationale & Hypothesis**  

### 2.1. Justification of Research Paradigm  

TOOL 1 SUGGESTION: 
Justify your ecologically/clinically relevant paradigm. 
- Compare it to lab-based alternatives (e.g., "[REAL-WORLD ASSAY] mimics [CONDITION] better than [TRADITIONAL ASSAY]"). 
- Cite validation studies if available.
--->
[paradigm justification...]

<!--- 
### 2.2. Innovative Analytical/Metric Approach  

TOOL 2 SUGGESTION: 
Explain your novel analytical/metric approach. 
- Highlight how it addresses Layer 3 limitations (e.g., "[COMPOSITE INDEX] integrates [MULTI-SYSTEM SIGNALS]"). 
- Cite technical validation papers.
--->
[method explanation...]

<!--- 
### 2.3. Hypothesis Formulation  

HYPOTHESIS SUGGESTION: 
Explicitly state how your approach resolves the gap. Use the formula:
"By combining [TOOL 1] with [TOOL 2], this study tests the hypothesis that [CONDITION] disrupts [MECHANISM] through [PATHWAY]."
--->
[hypothesis statement...]

<!--- 
## 3. **Anticipated Impact & Translation**

### 3.1. Mechanistic Impact  

MECHANISTIC IMPACT SUGGESTION: 
Explain how findings could refine fundamental understanding. Example:
"Clarifying [X] may disentangle [Y] from [Z] in [SYSTEM], resolving long-standing debates about [CONTROVERSY]."
--->
[mechanistic impact...]

<!--- 
### 3.2. Clinical Translation  

CLINICAL TRANSLATION SUGGESTION: 
Link mechanisms to actionable insights. Example:
"Identifying [BIOMARKER/PATHWAY] could guide [INTERVENTION] for [SUBGROUP], addressing [UNMET CLINICAL NEED]."
--->
[clinical translation...]

<!--- 
### 3.3. Paradigm Shift in Methodology  

PARADIGM SHIFT SUGGESTION: 
Highlight broader methodological implications. Example:
"This [METHODOLOGY] bridges [DISCIPLINE 1] and [DISCIPLINE 2], enabling future studies of [COMPLEX PHENOMENA]."
--->
[paradigm shift...]

<!--- 
## 4. **Additional Considerations**  

### 4.1. Rhetorical Devices & Integration  

RHETORICAL DEVICES SUGGESTION: 
- Use citation clusters thematically (e.g., group mechanistic studies separately from clinical papers). 
- Employ contrastive syntax to emphasize gaps ("Although...", "However..."). 
- Connect methods to hypotheses with bridging language ("To resolve this, we...").
--->
[narrative integration and rhetorical devices...]

<!--- 
Final Checklist for Blueprint Consistency 

FINAL CHECKLIST: 
- [ ] Hook ties condition to mechanism in ≤3 sentences 
- [ ] Gap narrative progresses: Consensus → Contradictions → Method limitations 
- [ ] Hypothesis explicitly links tools to the gap 
- [ ] Impact addresses both basic science and translation
